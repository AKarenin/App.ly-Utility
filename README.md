This project is developed on behalf of the App.ly Coding team, and as the sole developer, I am happy to announce
that every function is correctly working, and I can finally display a README section. Here are the defining characteristics of the app.

1. Library Room Reservation system:
- The app is a library room reserving app for our school in SFS. Currently, the reservation only works in the lunch periods (4,5,6)
- Using two-way communication, the system changed from having a "reload" feature to an automatically updated system. This was implemented as there
were times when people wanted to book two rooms at the same time, and the METADATA in the firebase for it caused an error.
- An admin can close and open the app. This allows teacher reservation to be more powerful than student's reservation, as they are primarily for exam purposes.
2. Cafeteria Menu displaying system:
- After talking with crave, our school cafeteria, this idea was transferred into the Crave app dashboard, which I am currently a co-developer on. 
- However, I can still manually update each menu, and if some students want this feature to be available, I can gladly do so.
3. Google SSO
- To use this app, you need Google SSO and a seoul foreign school email address.
- This feature was really hard to make, and I had to learn a lot in a short amount of time (2 weeks)

Thank you for reading!
